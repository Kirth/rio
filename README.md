**R**epeatable **I**/**O**.

Rio is part of the [Timeless Stack](https://github.com/polydawn/timeless) --
it handles packing, unpacking, syncing, copying, and hashing of Filesets.

In other words, Rio is tooling for repeatable, reproducible, filesystem I/O and transport.
It's both a command line tool, and usable as a series of libraries.

(You may also want to check out [Repeatr](https://github.com/polydawn/repeatr),
which is the container executor in the Timeless Stack -- it uses Rio under the hood
to provide snapshotting and decentralized sync of container filesystem images.)
