/*
	Interfaces of rio commands.

	The heuristic for the rio callable library API is that essentially
	all information must be racked up in the call already: the assumption
	is that the side doing the real work might not share a filesystem with
	you (well, in rio's case, it probably does!  but it might be a subset,
	translated through chroots and bind mounts), doesn't share env vars, etc.
	So, general rule of thumb: the caller is going to have already handled
	all config loading and parsing, and those objects are params in this funcs.
